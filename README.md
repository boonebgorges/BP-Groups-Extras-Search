# BP Groups Extras - Search

Make custom content, created by BP Groups Extras, searchable.

## How it works?

BPGE plugin allows you to create custom groups fields and pages. But they are not searchable by BuddyPress be default. This extension allows you to search from BuddyPress Groups directory for those fields and pages content.

Search results even show you where exactly the search term was found: in a field or in a page.
